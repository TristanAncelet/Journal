## What will it contain?

This repo will contain notes partiaining to issues ive encountered current or otherwise. 

These notes will include:

- Error messages pertaining to the problems I have or am dealing with.

- Links to pages that contain information on probable causes of the particular issue, as well as a list of all included packages and if needed where to find them



## Why am I making this?

I don't expect many (if any) people to read this. However, I plan to use this to help improve my documentation skills, as well as to help anyone else that may be going through something similar. 

## Closing Statement
If anyone does read this and is having any issues I'd be more than happy to help if I can. It'll help me improve my understanding of linux as well as I get to help someone else. As they say "kill two birds with one stone".
